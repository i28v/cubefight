This is an assignment for TechTrep where I make a c++ game while explaining how it was made.

The game will be like this:

.1 You play as a cube
.2 Enemy cubes spawn at the sides of the game and attack You
.3 You have to shoot the cubes and you will earn score from it 

Open up the .cpp and .h files for the documentation
